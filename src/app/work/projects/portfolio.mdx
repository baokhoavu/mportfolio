A portfolio built using Gatsby with MDX for copy and image integration. Data is retrieved using GraphQL for refined, component-driven queries. The project emphasizes responsive design using Tailwind and reusable content components.

This iteration focuses on improved componentization, optimized image delivery, and clearer content-authoring workflows so non-developers can update pages safely.

## Key challenges

- Maintaining a single source of truth for content while enabling flexible page layouts.
- Optimizing image loading and responsive behavior across varied content blocks.

## Impact

- Reduced content update time by enabling authors to use MDX components.
- Improved page load performance through targeted GraphQL queries and responsive assets.
