Gbportfolio is a one-page portfolio application architected for modern web standards, security, and developer experience. Built with React 18 and Vite, it leverages Tailwind CSS for a utility-first, responsive UI, and MDX for rich content authoring. The project is hardened with enterprise-grade security: CodeQL static analysis, daily dependency audits, secret detection, and strict runtime security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options). Automated CI/CD pipelines enforce code quality, run security checks, and deploy to Vercel or Netlify with zero vulnerabilities. Testing is handled by Vitest for fast, reliable feedback, and Biome ensures code quality and consistency. The site is SEO-optimized, accessible, and PWA-ready, with performance and error monitoring in place. All configuration and environment variables are centralized for secure, maintainable deployments.


## Key challenges

- Enforcing security best practices across the stack, including static analysis, dependency audits, and runtime protection.
- Achieving fast, reliable builds and deployments with Vite and automated CI/CD.
- Ensuring accessibility, SEO, and performance compliance for enterprise-grade standards.
- Managing content and configuration securely with MDX and environment validation.


## Impact

- Achieved zero vulnerabilities across all security scans and audits.
- Delivered sub-second page loads and high Lighthouse scores through modern tooling and best practices.
- Enabled rapid, secure deployments with automated pipelines and pre-deployment validation.
- Provided a maintainable, extensible foundation for future portfolio and content growth.
