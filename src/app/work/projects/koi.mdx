KOI is a web app that tracks and visualizes participant data for Ride to Conquer Cancer, OneWalk, and a growing list of fundraising events and campaigns. Designed for scalability, KOI supports multi-event and multi-locale data tracking for cycling, walking, and all cancer-related charity events, including Enbridge-sponsored campaigns. The platform features a modern Material Design UI built with Angular and Angular Material, and a backend powered by Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Secure JWT authentication enables role-based access for participants, admins, and campaign managers. Vite delivers ultra-fast development and hot reloads, while RxJS and SCSS provide reactive programming and modern styling. Data tables and charts allow users to filter, sort, and explore event statistics in real time. KOI is optimized for desktop and mobile, deployed on Vercel, and architected for easy expansion to future fundraising events and campaign types.
