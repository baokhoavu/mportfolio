KristeenaJS is a modern e-commerce platform designed for esports fans to support their favorite gamers. Instead of traditional donations, fans purchase exclusive digital or branded items, with each purchase directly funding player needs like training, equipment, and travel. The platform is built with Next.js 16, TypeScript, and SCSS, and leverages Snipcart for secure, seamless e-commerce functionality. The mobile-first UI ensures a smooth experience on any device, while security is enforced through environment variables, input validation, and secure deployment on Vercel. The project structure supports rapid prototyping, modular development, and easy configuration for new campaigns or teams.


## Key challenges

- Integrating Snipcart for secure, donation-based e-commerce flows tailored to esports.

## Impact

- Enabled direct, transparent support for esports players through product purchases.
- Delivered a secure, conversion-optimized shopping experience for fans and gamers.
